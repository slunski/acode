AaBbCc etc with numbers (starting from 0), becouse ASCII is bloated :)
Usefull for communication, hopefully.

Realy, becouse Unicode introduced zero-length-idiocy. Or even invisible-idiocy.
Maybe some langs need this but so far it's just allowing your app/communication
to be hacked.

.acode tables can be defined on the fly, as you need one.

Currently .acode files are mappings into ASCII symbols but that is just convenience.

Not used bits are considered cleared by default.

You are free to do whatever in your app [part] but any interaction with any-one/thing
should be agreed via interchanging .acode table. We will blame you if you deviate
from agreement :)  No standard embrancing & using offensively allowed.

Format: sequence of pairs of numbers and symbols.

Usually just sequence of 2*pairs_number*X in computer memory where X is eg. byte (8 bits).
Or pairs_nomber*(X+Y) where Y is size required for representing one symbol, see
mud.acode file for example. Or whatever you need in your implementation.

New line character/functionality should be encoded as one symbol/number.

If you want to use just 8 bit and 256 pairs is exceeded you can use something
similiar to UTF-8. You got the idea.

Common order: XXX CHECK
- big letters before small for simple sorting.
- numbers instantly after alphas, punctuation instantly after al-nums.

Note: don't fool yourself that mixing order (aka Ceasar cipher) is something
meaningful in cryptography department :)
